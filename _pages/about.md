I recently defended my PhD in Computer Science at **McGill University**, conducted at **Mila – Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute**, 
under the supervision of <a href='https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/'>Doina Precup</a> and <a href='https://linclab.mila.quebec/team/blake'>Blake Richards</a>. 
My research bridges reinforcement learning and computational neuroscience, investigating how principles such as predictive 
representations and memory consolidation can inform the design of adaptive, continually learning AI systems.

My doctoral work addressed the *plasticity–stability dilemma* in reinforcement learning through structured predictive 
representations and multi-timescale learning mechanisms, demonstrating how biologically inspired approaches can reduce 
interference while preserving adaptability.

Building on this foundation, I am increasingly interested in mechanistic interpretability — using tools inspired by 
neuroscience, such as representation similarity analysis and cross-attention probing, to understand how predictive 
representations (e.g., successor features) encode and transform information over time. I am particularly motivated by 
questions at the intersection of continual learning, foundation models, and embodied decision-making systems.

Beyond research, I’m passionate about improving AI capabilities through 
<a href='https://raymondchua.github.io/mentorship/'>academic–industry partnerships</a>, where I mentor students from 
McGill, UdeM, and Mila as they tackle real-world challenges with companies seeking to integrate machine learning into 
their products and pipelines. During my free time, I enjoy pushing both my intellectual and physical abilities through 
triathlon, which continues to teach me about endurance, balance, and growth.
