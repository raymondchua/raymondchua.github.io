Iâ€™m a doctoral candidate at McGill University and Mila, advised by <a href='https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/'>Doina Precup</a> and <a href='https://linclab.mila.quebec/team/blake'>Blake Richards</a>. Their expertise in 
machine learning and computational neuroscience has been instrumental in shaping my approach to exploring the intricate 
relationship between artificial intelligence and brain function. My work dives into how neural mechanisms of representation 
and memory can be modeled to enhance AI's adaptability and efficiency. By integrating insights from neuroscience, I aim to 
develop AI systems capable of continuous learning and adept at navigating unpredictable environments. 

My personal connection to this work stems from having a family member with learning disabilities, which has deeply motivated me to 
understand how our brains function and why some people face challenges in learning. Through my research, I hope to advance our 
understanding of these fundamental processes and create AI systems that could one day assist individuals 
with learning difficulties, making my work relevant not only to the scientific community but to society as a whole.

Beyond academia, the Covid-19 pandemic rekindled my passion for sports, leading me to cross-country skiing, swimming, cycling, and 
runningâ€”culminating in participating in triathlons. I have dedicated a section under the projects page to share these adventures, offering a glimpse 
into my life beyond academia. Free free to check it out, or visit my <a href='https://www.instagram.com/raymondrchua/'>Instagram</a>
