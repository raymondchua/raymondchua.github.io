I’m a doctoral candidate at McGill University and Mila, guided by Doina Precup and Blake Richards. Their expertise in 
machine learning and computational neuroscience has been instrumental in shaping my approach to exploring the intricate 
relationship between artificial intelligence and brain function. My work dives into how neural mechanisms of representation 
and memory can be modeled to enhance AI's adaptability and efficiency.

By integrating insights from neuroscience, I aim to develop AI systems capable of continuous learning and proficient in 
navigating unpredictable environments. This work not only advances AI but also opens new pathways to unravel the brain’s 
mysteries, potentially revolutionizing fields like medicine and psychology, and inching closer to the realm of artificial 
general intelligence.

The Covid-19 pandemic rekindled my passion for sports, leading me to cross-country skiing, swimming, cycling, and 
running—culminating in participating in triathlons. I have dedicated a page to share these adventures, offering a glimpse 
into my life beyond academia. Check it out, or visit my <a href='https://www.instagram.com/raymondrchua/'>Instagram</a>
