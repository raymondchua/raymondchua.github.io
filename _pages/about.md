*Last updated 25 Feb 2026.*

I recently defended my PhD in Computer Science at **McGill University**, conducted at **Mila – Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute**, where I investigated how principles from neuroscience — particularly *predictive representations* and *memory consolidation* — can inform the design of adaptive, continually learning AI systems.

My doctoral work focused on addressing the *plasticity–stability dilemma* in reinforcement learning through structured representations and multi-timescale learning mechanisms.

I am a final-year PhD candidate at McGill University and Mila, supervised by <a href='https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/'>Doina Precup</a> and <a href='https://linclab.mila.quebec/team/blake'>Blake Richards</a>. 
My research bridges machine learning and computational neuroscience, exploring how neural mechanisms of representation and memory can inspire more adaptive and continual learning in artificial agents. Building on this foundation, 
I am increasingly interested in mechanistic interpretability, using techniques inspired by neuroscience — such as representation similarity analysis and cross-attention probing — to understand how predictive representations such as successor features 
encode and transform information over time. I’m expected to graduate in Spring 2026 and am seeking opportunities to study and design learning systems that bridge theory (reinforcement learning), scalable models (foundation and language models), and 
real-world decision-making (robotics, embodied AI, and autonomous systems).

Beyond research, I’m passionate about improving AI capabilities through <a href='https://raymondchua.github.io/mentorship/'>academic–industry partnerships</a>, where I mentor students from McGill, UdeM, and Mila as they tackle real-world challenges with companies seeking to integrate machine learning into 
their products and pipelines. During my free time, I enjoy pushing both my intellectual and physical abilities through triathlon, which continues to teach me about endurance, balance, and growth.
