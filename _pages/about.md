I’m a doctoral candidate at McGill University and Mila, guided by Doina Precup and Blake Richards. Their expertise in machine learning and computational neuroscience has been instrumental in shaping my approach to exploring the intricate relationship between artificial intelligence and brain function. My work dives into how neural mechanisms of representation and memory can be modeled to enhance AI's adaptability and efficiency.

By integrating insights from neuroscience, I aim to develop AI systems capable of continuous learning and proficient in navigating unpredictable environments. This work not only advances AI but also opens new pathways to unravel the brain’s mysteries, potentially revolutionizing fields like medicine and psychology, and inching closer to the realm of artificial general intelligence.

The Covid-19 pandemic rekindled my passion for sports, leading me to cross-country skiing, swimming, cycling, and running—culminating in participating in triathlons. I have dedicated a page to share these adventures, offering a glimpse into my life beyond academia. Check it out, or visit my <a style='color: black;' href='https://www.instagram.com/raymondrchua/'>Instagram</a> to see what keeps me busy when I’m not at my computer!
