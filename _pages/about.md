*Last updated 23 Feb 2025.*

I‚Äôm a (final-year) doctoral candidate at McGill University and Mila, advised by <a href='https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/'>Doina Precup</a> and <a href='https://linclab.mila.quebec/team/blake'>Blake Richards</a>. Their expertise in 
machine learning and computational neuroscience has been instrumental in shaping my approach to exploring the intricate 
relationship between artificial intelligence and brain function. My work dives into how neural mechanisms of representation 
and memory can be modeled to enhance AI's adaptability and efficiency. By integrating insights from neuroscience, I aim to 
develop AI systems capable of continuous learning and adept at navigating unpredictable environments. 

My expected graduation date is in ***Fall 2025*** and will be on the lookout for post-graduation opportunities in academia, industry, or research labs.

In addition to my research, I am actively involved in mentoring emerging talent in the field of machine learning. 
I supervise students from McGill University, University of Montreal, and Mila who are pursuing challenging internships with leading companies in Montreal and Quebec. 
These internships, lasting 6-9 months, often blend real-world applications with research components, addressing new problems where established methods do not yet exist. 
My role involves advising both the students and sometimes the companies on the selection of machine learning models, developing data pipelines, and refining model performance. 
This mentorship not only allows me to give back to the academic community but also keeps me connected to the latest innovations in the industry. 
For more detailed information about the students and projects I have mentored, please visit [my mentorship page](https://raymondchua.github.io/mentorship/).

My personal connection to this work stems from having a family member with learning disabilities, which has deeply motivated me to 
understand how our brains function and why some people face challenges in learning. Through my research, I hope to advance our 
understanding of these fundamental processes and create AI systems that could one day assist individuals 
with learning difficulties, making my work relevant not only to the scientific community but to society as a whole.

Beyond academia, the Covid-19 pandemic rekindled my passion for sports, leading me to cross-country skiing, swimming, cycling, and 
running‚Äîculminating in participating in triathlons. I have dedicated a section under the projects page to share these adventures, offering a glimpse 
into my life beyond academia. Feel free to check it out, or visit my <a href='https://www.instagram.com/raymondrchua/'>Instagram</a> 
to see what keeps me busy when I‚Äôm not at my computer!
