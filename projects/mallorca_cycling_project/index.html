The journey from the airport to Bunyola was quiet, with the anticipation of the upcoming adventure making every moment feel suspended in time.</p> <p><strong>First Morning in Bunyola</strong> As dawn broke, I found myself in Bunyola, a picturesque town cradled by the Tramuntana mountains. Waking up in this serene setting was like stepping into a painting. The morning light painted the town in hues of gold, and every angle offered a postcard-worthy view.</p> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/../assets/img/mallorca_cycling_2024/bunyola_2.png" alt="bunyola_2" width="60%" height="60%"> </figure> <p><strong>Exploring Bunyola</strong> Strolling through Bunyola’s quaint streets, I was immediately struck by the town’s vibrant character. Locals take pride in their gardening, which was evident from the lush plants and colorful flowers that adorned every nook and cranny. The flowers cascaded from balconies and thrived in courtyards, bringing life and color to the stone paths and ancient walls.</p> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/../assets/img/mallorca_cycling_2024/bunyola_3.png" alt="bunyola_3" width="60%" height="60%"> </figure> <p><strong>Architectural Charms</strong> The traditional Mallorcan architecture was a sight to behold, with its distinctive green window frames standing out against the earthy tones of the buildings. This unique feature added a depth of character to the town, highlighting a style that was both rustic and inviting.</p> <p><strong>Reflections</strong> My first day in Bunyola was an enchanting introduction to Mallorca’s charm. The combination of natural beauty and meticulous architecture promised that this journey would be memorable. I was eager to see what the rest of the trip had in store, and I knew that each day would reveal more of the island’s hidden treasures.</p> <h1 id="day-two-lakeside-stop-and-a-warm-welcome-at-the-hotel">Day Two: Lakeside Stop and a Warm Welcome at the Hotel</h1> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/../assets/img/mallorca_cycling_2024/hotel_transit_1.png" alt="lake_1" width="60%" height="60%"> <figcaption>A Breathtaking Pit Stop</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Arrival and First Impressions</strong> After an invigorating morning in Bunyola, our journey continued through the heart of Mallorca’s mountainous landscape. The drive itself was a spectacle, with every turn revealing expansive views that demanded to be captured.</p> <p><strong>A Breathtaking Pit Stop</strong> Midway through the journey, we made a pit stop beside a stunning lake nestled among the peaks. The tranquility of the water, reflecting the clear blue skies, offered a perfect contrast to the ruggedness of our earlier drive. The first photo captures this serene moment, a tranquil pause that refreshed the spirit.</p> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/../assets/img/mallorca_cycling_2024/hotel_transit_2.png" alt="lake_2" width="60%" height="60%"> </figure> <p><strong>Arriving at the Hotel</strong> Our final destination for the day was the hotel, a charming family-run establishment that awaited with the promise of rest and hospitality.

But this wasn’t just any hotel. Housed in a gothic-style family home from the 15th century, it has been lovingly transformed by its owners, preserving its historical charm while offering modern comforts. The architecture and the stories embedded in its walls made staying here feel like stepping into a living history book.</p> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/../assets/img/mallorca_cycling_2024/hotel_transit_5.png" alt="lake_5" width="60%" height="60%"> </figure> <p><strong>Personal Touch and Off-Peak Perks</strong> What made the stay truly memorable was the personal touch in every detail, reflecting the family’s dedication to preserving their heritage. Moreover, traveling during the off-peak season brought an unexpected benefit—a generous discount that made this exquisite experience even more gratifying.</p> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/../assets/img/mallorca_cycling_2024/hotel_transit_6.png" alt="lake_6" width="60%" height="60%"> </figure> <h1 id="conquering-cap-de-formentor-my-first-outdoor-climb-after-a-long-montreal-winter">Conquering Cap de Formentor: My First Outdoor Climb After a Long Montreal Winter</h1> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/../assets/img/mallorca_cycling_2024/lighthouse_1.png" alt="formentor_1" width="60%" height="60%"> <figcaption>Cap de Formentor: A Challenge and a Reward</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Kicking Off the Cycling Season at Cap de Formentor</strong> After months of enduring the harsh, icy grip of a Montreal winter, my cycling journey brought me to the roads of Mallorca, where I faced a different kind of challenge: the iconic Cap de Formentor. Known for its breathtaking views and rigorous demands, this route promised to test my limits and reward my efforts with unparalleled natural beauty.</p> <p><strong>The Cap de Formentor route is not just a path</strong> It’s a journey through some of Mallorca’s most stunning landscapes. The road winds like a serpent, with steep inclines that challenge even seasoned cyclists. Each pedal stroke brought a mix of exertion and exhilaration, as I navigated the 35 kilometers of roadway that ascended a total of 1000 meters. The azure waves of the Mediterranean contrasted sharply with the rugged cliffs, creating a visual feast that spurred me onward.</p> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/../assets/img/mallorca_cycling_2024/lighthouse_4.png" alt="formentor_2" width="60%" height="60%"> </figure> <p><strong>Historical Significance</strong> One of the most captivating aspects of Cap de Formentor is not just its natural beauty but its rich history. The lighthouse at the road’s end, a beacon for ships since the 19th century, stands as a testament to human perseverance and ingenuity. Constructing this lighthouse was a monumental effort—massive stones were transported up the winding roads with nothing but a winch and the sheer strength of 40 men. Knowing the history of the road beneath my wheels deepened my connection to the landscape, making each turn and climb feel like a passage through time.</p> <p>As I pushed my limits on this challenging ride, I found myself reflecting on more than just the physical effort. This climb was a poignant reminder of what we can achieve with determination. Fresh out of a long winter, where the cold often confines and restricts us, here I was, conquering new heights and rediscovering my own strength. It was a powerful affirmation that challenges, whether they be from nature or self-imposed limits, are surmountable.</p> <p><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong> Completing the climb to Cap de Formentor was more than just a physical achievement; it was a transformative experience that intertwined the beauty of Mallorca with the profound stories of its past. This journey was a perfect start to my cycling season, reminding me that with enough determination, we can overcome any obstacle and learn something incredible along the way.</p> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/../assets/img/mallorca_cycling_2024/lighthouse_3.png" alt="formentor_3" width="60%" height="60%"> </figure> <h2 id="a-rainy-day-at-velovie-more-than-just-a-cycling-café">A Rainy Day at Velovie: More Than Just a Cycling Café</h2> <h3 id="unexpected-turn-leads-to-a-charming-discovery">Unexpected Turn Leads to a Charming Discovery</h3> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/../assets/img/mallorca_cycling_2024/velovie_1.png" alt="velovie_1" width="60%" height="60%"> <figcaption>Unexpected Rainy Day Stopover</figcaption> </figure> <p>What was meant to be a day on the roads turned into a cozy stopover thanks to a sudden downpour. But every cyclist knows that a change in weather is just another route to a new adventure. This particular rainy day brought me to the doors of Velovie, a quaint café that’s quickly become a hub for cycling enthusiasts in Mallorca.</p> <h3 id="warm-welcomes-and-homemade-delights">Warm Welcomes and Homemade Delights</h3> <p>Owned by Elsa and Jamie, two passionate cyclists who fell in love with Mallorca’s landscapes, Velovie is more than just a café; it’s a meeting point for tales of trails and rides. Their warmth was palpable, as was their enthusiasm for sharing their experiences. As I settled into the comfortable setting, I was treated to homemade cakes—each bite a testament to the café’s homely vibe. The café buzzed with conversations, and the air was thick with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and rain-soaked earth.</p> <h3 id="bonding-over-wheels-and-cakes">Bonding Over Wheels and Cakes</h3> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/../assets/img/mallorca_cycling_2024/velovie_2.png" alt="velovie_2" width="60%" height="60%"> </figure> <p>It wasn’t long before I found myself engrossed in conversations about favorite routes and cycling challenges with other patrons. The café’s resident dog, JJ, was a cheerful presence, nudging everyone into a game of fetch between their stories and sips. This place wasn’t just a shelter from the rain; it was a delightful blend of community and passion.</p> <h3 id="encounters-with-cycling-legends">Encounters with Cycling Legends</h3> <p>Adding to Velovie’s charm is its reputation as a stopover for some of the sport’s greats, including members from the renowned <a href="https://ineosgrenadier.com/en/ca/explore/ineos-grenadier-partners/ineos-grenadiers" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ineos Grenadier</a> team.

Jamie, with his extensive knowledge of Mallorca’s routes, sat down with me over a map strewn across the wall. He shared invaluable tips and insights that only a seasoned local cyclist could offer. From the best times to start the ride to avoid the crowds, to challenging turns I should be wary of, Jamie’s advice was golden.</p> <h3 id="looking-forward-to-sa-calobra">Looking Forward to Sa Calobra</h3> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/../assets/img/mallorca_cycling_2024/velovie_4.png" alt="velovie_4" width="60%" height="60%"> </figure> <p>With a belly full of cake and a heart full of inspiration, I left Velovie not just ready but excited for the road ahead.
