Had the pleasure of giving an invited talk at <a href='https://www.graphcore.ai'>Graphcore</a> in London, where I presented my work on brain-inspired continual reinforcement learning. Great conversations with the team about bridging neuroscience and ML, and exciting to see the strong research culture there.
