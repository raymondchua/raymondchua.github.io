Visited <a href='https://cclopath.bg-research.cc.ic.ac.uk'>Prof. Claudia Clopath</a>'s lab at Imperial College London, where I gave a talk on our work titled "Brain-Inspired Continual Reinforcement Learning Agents." I have met Claudia numerous times throughout my PhD journey, from Cosyne to giving a talk at our Biological and Artificial RL workshop at NeurIPS in 2020. It is my great honor to be able to spend time with her lab and learned about what they are working on as well!
