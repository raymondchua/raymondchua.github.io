Invited by <a href='https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/paul-masset'>"Prof. Paul Masset"</a> to give a talk on my research on Successor Features and Continual Reinforcement Learning at 
his lab in McGill University, Montr√©al. The talk was well-received, and I had the opportunity to discuss my work with several members of his lab. 
Look forward to future collaborations with the lab and hope to visit again soon!
