Visited <a href='https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/team/rui-ponte-costa'>"Prof. Rui Ponte Costa"</a>'s lab at University of Oxford, where I gave a talk on my work titled "Brain-Inspired Continual Reinforcement Learning Agents." Rui was my master thesis supervisor, and it was wonderful to reconnect with him and his lab again!
