Excited to share that my first collaborative work, <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06981'>Deep RL Needs Deep Behavior Analysis: Exploring
Implicit Planning by Model-Free Agents in Open-Ended Environments</a> , with Riley Simmons-Edler, Ryan P. Badman, Felix Baastad Berg, John J. Vastola, Joshua Lunger, William Qian, and Kanaka Rajan, has been accepted to NeurIPS 2025!
We developed a foraging environment (based on Craftax) and trained PPO agents with compact GRUs, uncovering that even model-free agents can plan and recall across hundreds of timesteps.
