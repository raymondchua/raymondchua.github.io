My first research paper titled "Learning Successor Features the Simple Way," on which I am the primary first author, co-authored with <a href='https://arnaghosh.github.io/index.html'>Arna Ghosh</a>, Christos Kaplanis, Blake Richards and Doina Precup, has been accepted to the Neural Information Processing Systems conference (NeurIPS) a top-tier machine learning conference with a very selective 25.8% acceptance rate. Stay tuned for the preprint (Nov 2024)! ðŸŽ‰
