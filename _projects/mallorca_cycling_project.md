# Day 1: Arrival in Bunyola
Arriving in Palma at Night Upon landing in Palma, the night had already draped its calm over the city. The journey from 
the airport to Bunyola was quiet, with the anticipation of the upcoming adventure making every moment feel suspended in time.

**First Morning in Bunyola** As dawn broke, I found myself in Bunyola, a picturesque town cradled by the Tramuntana mountains. 
Waking up in this serene setting was like stepping into a painting. The morning light painted the town in hues of gold, 
and every angle offered a postcard-worthy view.

**Exploring Bunyola** Strolling through Bunyola's quaint streets, I was immediately struck by the town’s vibrant character. 
Locals take pride in their gardening, which was evident from the lush plants and colorful flowers that adorned every nook 
and cranny. The flowers cascaded from balconies and thrived in courtyards, bringing life and color to the stone paths 
and ancient walls.

**Architectural Charms** The traditional Mallorcan architecture was a sight to behold, with its distinctive green window 
frames standing out against the earthy tones of the buildings. This unique feature added a depth of character to the 
town, highlighting a style that was both rustic and inviting.

**Reflections** My first day in Bunyola was an enchanting introduction to Mallorca's charm. The combination of natural 
beauty and meticulous architecture promised that this journey would be memorable. I was eager to see what the rest of 
the trip had in store, and I knew that each day would reveal more of the island’s hidden treasures.

**Arrival and First Impressions** After an invigorating morning in Bunyola, our journey continued through the heart of 
Mallorca’s mountainous landscape. The drive itself was a spectacle, with every turn revealing expansive views that 
demanded to be captured.

**A Breathtaking Pit Stop** Midway through the journey, we made a pit stop beside a stunning lake nestled among the peaks. 
The tranquility of the water, reflecting the clear blue skies, offered a perfect contrast to the ruggedness of our earlier 
drive. The first photo captures this serene moment, a tranquil pause that refreshed the spirit.

**Arriving at the Hotel** Our final destination for the day was the hotel, a charming family-run establishment that 
awaited with the promise of rest and hospitality. The first sight that greeted me was my rental bike, poised at the 
entrance, a silent invitation to the adventures ahead. The photo of my bike against the hotel’s welcoming facade marks 
the official start of my cycling escapades.

From the inviting pool area to the cozy café and the elegant lounge, the spaces in the hotel provided not just comfort 
but a glimpse into the meticulous care the owners invest in their property.

As someone who generally prefers the bustling environment of hostels, opting for a hotel was a departure from my norm. 
But this wasn’t just any hotel. Housed in a gothic-style family home from the 15th century, it has been lovingly 
transformed by its owners, preserving its historical charm while offering modern comforts. The architecture and the stories 
embedded in its walls made staying here feel like stepping into a living history book.

**Personal Touch and Off-Peak Perks** What made the stay truly memorable was the personal touch in every detail, reflecting 
the family’s dedication to preserving their heritage. Moreover, traveling during the off-peak season brought an unexpected 
benefit—a generous discount that made this exquisite experience even more gratifying.
