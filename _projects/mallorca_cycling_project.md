# Day 1: Arrival in Bunyola
Arriving in Palma at Night Upon landing in Palma, the night had already draped its calm over the city. The journey from 
the airport to Bunyola was quiet, with the anticipation of the upcoming adventure making every moment feel suspended in time.

**First Morning in Bunyola** As dawn broke, I found myself in Bunyola, a picturesque town cradled by the Tramuntana mountains. 
Waking up in this serene setting was like stepping into a painting. The morning light painted the town in hues of gold, 
and every angle offered a postcard-worthy view.

**Exploring Bunyola** Strolling through Bunyola's quaint streets, I was immediately struck by the town’s vibrant character. 
Locals take pride in their gardening, which was evident from the lush plants and colorful flowers that adorned every nook 
and cranny. The flowers cascaded from balconies and thrived in courtyards, bringing life and color to the stone paths 
and ancient walls.

**Architectural Charms** The traditional Mallorcan architecture was a sight to behold, with its distinctive green window 
frames standing out against the earthy tones of the buildings. This unique feature added a depth of character to the 
town, highlighting a style that was both rustic and inviting.

**Reflections** My first day in Bunyola was an enchanting introduction to Mallorca's charm. The combination of natural 
beauty and meticulous architecture promised that this journey would be memorable. I was eager to see what the rest of 
the trip had in store, and I knew that each day would reveal more of the island’s hidden treasures.
