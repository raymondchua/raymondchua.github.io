## Day 1: Arrival in Bunyola
Arriving in Palma at Night Upon landing in Palma, the night had already draped its calm over the city. The journey from 
the airport to Bunyola was quiet, with the anticipation of the upcoming adventure making every moment feel suspended in time.

**First Morning in Bunyola** As dawn broke, I found myself in Bunyola, a picturesque town cradled by the Tramuntana mountains. 
Waking up in this serene setting was like stepping into a painting. The morning light painted the town in hues of gold, 
and every angle offered a postcard-worthy view.

**Exploring Bunyola** Strolling through Bunyola's quaint streets, I was immediately struck by the town’s vibrant character. 
Locals take pride in their gardening, which was evident from the lush plants and colorful flowers that adorned every nook 
and cranny. The flowers cascaded from balconies and thrived in courtyards, bringing life and color to the stone paths 
and ancient walls.

**Architectural Charms** The traditional Mallorcan architecture was a sight to behold, with its distinctive green window 
frames standing out against the earthy tones of the buildings. This unique feature added a depth of character to the 
town, highlighting a style that was both rustic and inviting.

**Reflections** My first day in Bunyola was an enchanting introduction to Mallorca's charm. The combination of natural 
beauty and meticulous architecture promised that this journey would be memorable. I was eager to see what the rest of 
the trip had in store, and I knew that each day would reveal more of the island’s hidden treasures.

**Arrival and First Impressions** After an invigorating morning in Bunyola, our journey continued through the heart of 
Mallorca’s mountainous landscape. The drive itself was a spectacle, with every turn revealing expansive views that 
demanded to be captured.

**A Breathtaking Pit Stop** Midway through the journey, we made a pit stop beside a stunning lake nestled among the peaks. 
The tranquility of the water, reflecting the clear blue skies, offered a perfect contrast to the ruggedness of our earlier 
drive. The first photo captures this serene moment, a tranquil pause that refreshed the spirit.

**Arriving at the Hotel** Our final destination for the day was the hotel, a charming family-run establishment that 
awaited with the promise of rest and hospitality. The first sight that greeted me was my rental bike, poised at the 
entrance, a silent invitation to the adventures ahead. The photo of my bike against the hotel’s welcoming facade marks 
the official start of my cycling escapades.

From the inviting pool area to the cozy café and the elegant lounge, the spaces in the hotel provided not just comfort 
but a glimpse into the meticulous care the owners invest in their property.

<figure style="text-align: center;">

As someone who generally prefers the bustling environment of hostels, opting for a hotel was a departure from my norm. 
But this wasn’t just any hotel. Housed in a gothic-style family home from the 15th century, it has been lovingly 
transformed by its owners, preserving its historical charm while offering modern comforts. The architecture and the stories 
embedded in its walls made staying here feel like stepping into a living history book.

**Personal Touch and Off-Peak Perks** What made the stay truly memorable was the personal touch in every detail, reflecting 
the family’s dedication to preserving their heritage. Moreover, traveling during the off-peak season brought an unexpected 
benefit—a generous discount that made this exquisite experience even more gratifying.

<figcaption>Cap de Formentor: A Challenge and a Reward</figcaption>
</figure>

**Kicking Off the Cycling Season at Cap de Formentor** After months of enduring the harsh, icy grip of a Montreal winter, my cycling journey brought me to the roads of Mallorca, 
where I faced a different kind of challenge: the iconic Cap de Formentor. Known for its breathtaking views and rigorous demands, 
this route promised to test my limits and reward my efforts with unparalleled natural beauty.

**The Cap de Formentor route is not just a path** It's a journey through some of Mallorca's most stunning landscapes. The road 
winds like a serpent, with steep inclines that challenge even seasoned cyclists. Each pedal stroke brought a mix of exertion 
and exhilaration, as I navigated the 35 kilometers of roadway that ascended a total of 1000 meters. The azure waves of the 
Mediterranean contrasted sharply with the rugged cliffs, creating a visual feast that spurred me onward.

<figure style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/../assets/img/mallorca_cycling_2024/lighthouse_4.png" alt="formentor_2" width="60%" height="60%">
</figure>

**Historical Significance** One of the most captivating aspects of Cap de Formentor is not just its natural beauty but its 
rich history. The lighthouse at the road's end, a beacon for ships since the 19th century, stands as a testament to human 
perseverance and ingenuity. Constructing this lighthouse was a monumental effort—massive stones were transported up the 
winding roads with nothing but a winch and the sheer strength of 40 men. Knowing the history of the road beneath my wheels 
deepened my connection to the landscape, making each turn and climb feel like a passage through time.

As I pushed my limits on this challenging ride, I found myself reflecting on more than just the physical effort. This 
climb was a poignant reminder of what we can achieve with determination. Fresh out of a long winter, where the cold often 
confines and restricts us, here I was, conquering new heights and rediscovering my own strength. It was a powerful 
affirmation that challenges, whether they be from nature or self-imposed limits, are surmountable.

**Concluding Thoughts** Completing the climb to Cap de Formentor was more than just a physical achievement; it was a transformative experience 
that intertwined the beauty of Mallorca with the profound stories of its past. This journey was a perfect start to my 
cycling season, reminding me that with enough determination, we can overcome any obstacle and learn something incredible 
along the way.

### Unexpected Turn Leads to a Charming Discovery

What was meant to be a day on the roads turned into a cozy stopover thanks to a sudden downpour. But every cyclist knows 
that a change in weather is just another route to a new adventure. This particular rainy day brought me to the doors of 
Velovie, a quaint café that's quickly become a hub for cycling enthusiasts in Mallorca.

### Warm Welcomes and Homemade Delights

Owned by Elsa and Jamie, two passionate cyclists who fell in love with Mallorca’s landscapes, Velovie is more than just 
a café; it's a meeting point for tales of trails and rides. Their warmth was palpable, as was their enthusiasm for sharing 
their experiences. As I settled into the comfortable setting, I was treated to homemade cakes—each bite a testament to 
the café's homely vibe. The café buzzed with conversations, and the air was thick with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee 
and rain-soaked earth.

<figure style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/../assets/img/mallorca_cycling_2024/velovie_2.png" alt="velovie_2" width="60%" height="60%">
</figure>

It wasn’t long before I found myself engrossed in conversations about favorite routes and cycling challenges with other 
patrons. The café’s resident dog, JJ, was a cheerful presence, nudging everyone into a game of fetch between their stories 
and sips. This place wasn’t just a shelter from the rain; it was a delightful blend of community and passion.

### Encounters with Cycling Legends

Adding to Velovie's charm is its reputation as a stopover for some of the sport’s greats, including members from the 
renowned <a href='https://ineosgrenadier.com/en/ca/explore/ineos-grenadier-partners/ineos-grenadiers'>Ineos Grenadier</a> 
team. Knowing that the very same space was frequented by iconic cyclists added a layer of awe and respect to the ambiance.

### Planning the Ride to Sa Calobra

<figure style="text-align: center;">

The highlight of my visit, however, was planning my upcoming ride to Sa Calobra. Jamie, with his extensive knowledge of 
Mallorca’s routes, sat down with me over a map strewn across the wall. He shared invaluable tips and insights that only 
a seasoned local cyclist could offer. From the best times to start the ride to avoid the crowds, to challenging turns I 
should be wary of, Jamie’s advice was golden.

### Looking Forward to Sa Calobra

<figure style="text-align: center;">

With a belly full of cake and a heart full of inspiration, I left Velovie not just ready but excited for the road ahead. 
Sa Calobra awaited, and thanks to my stop at this local gem, I felt more prepared and eager for the challenges it would 
bring.

### The Start of a Legendary Climb

The morning was crisp as I set out from Coll de Femenia, legs fresh and mind set on the challenge ahead. Sa Calobra, 
known for its beauty as much as its brutality, beckoned. As the sun began its slow rise over the mountains, its rays 
illuminated the path that would lead me through one of cycling’s most revered adventures.

### Majestic Views at Every Turn

Pedaling forward, each turn of the winding road brought into view breathtaking scenes where majestic mountains met the 
shimmering sea. This Mediterranean paradise was more than just a backdrop; it was a vital part of the experience, with 
its awe-inspiring landscapes energizing my ascent. The iconic hairpin bends unfolded before me, each one a story of its 
own, and the stunning coastal vistas offered fleeting moments of respite from the physical exertion.

</figure>

Thanks to the sage advice from Jamie at Hobbits Ride Bikes, I strategically paused at Coll de sa Bataia to refuel with 
snacks and a robust cup of coffee. It was here that I encountered the beloved Orange Juice Man, a fixture along this 
route whose freshly squeezed juices provided a much-needed boost just after the aqueduct. His cheerful demeanor and the 
sweet tang of orange became a part of this cherished tradition among cyclists tackling Sa Calobra.

After the grueling climb, the summit offered more than just relief; it delivered a sense of triumph. To celebrate, I 
stopped at a nearby cycling café, newly opened by Emma and Javi at Sarutaverda. Their passion for cycling and the friendly 
atmosphere they created was a perfect end to an intense ride. The cappuccino there wasn't just good; it was a reward, 
each sip a celebration of the climb conquered.

### Reflections on a Dream Fulfilled

Embarking on the 9.4km climb of Sa Calobra was not just about testing my physical limits; it was a journey through history, 
embracing the spirit of countless cyclists who had taken on this legendary route. The steep inclines, the serpentine road, 
and the thrill of reaching new heights made this more than just a ride; it was an exhilarating adventure that tested my 
resolve and rewarded my efforts with unforgettable memories.

### A Day Off the Bike and On the Court

After days of intense cycling across Mallorca's challenging landscapes, I took a well-deserved break to explore a different 
kind of sporting excellence at the Rafa Nadal Academy. Nestled in the heart of Mallorca, this academy isn’t just a training 
ground for aspiring tennis stars; it’s a shrine to one of tennis’s greatest players.

### Exploring the Museum

<figure style="text-align: center;">

</figure>

My day began at the academy’s museum, which houses a collection dedicated to Rafael Nadal's storied career. While I had 
hoped for a deeper exploration into Nadal's early life and his initial steps into the world of tennis, the exhibits mainly 
focused on his professional achievements. From his Grand Slam trophies to his Olympic gold medal, each artifact was a 
testament to his dedication and skill. Despite the slight disappointment in the scope of the narrative, the display was 
still impressive, showcasing a wide array of memorabilia that painted a picture of his journey through the echelons of 
tennis history.

### A Tennis Enthusiast’s Paradise

<figure style="text-align: center;">

</figure>

However, the true highlight of my visit was the academy's facilities themselves. Stepping onto the pristine courts, I 
could feel the charged atmosphere, a space where dedication meets ambition. The state-of-the-art facilities, designed to 
forge the next generation of tennis talent, were indeed a dream come true for any tennis enthusiast. Each court echoed 
with the potential of future champions, and the comprehensive training environment was a clear indicator of the academy’s 
commitment to nurturing world-class athletes.

Spending the day here allowed me to appreciate another facet of elite sports. As I walked through the training areas, 
watched young athletes in training, and absorbed the passionate environment, I was reminded of the universal qualities 
shared by all top athletes: dedication, resilience, and an unyielding desire to excel. The academy didn't just serve as 
a tourist spot; it was an inspirational hub, mirroring the spirit of its founder.

As my rest day drew to a close, I felt refreshed and inspired, ready to take on the next leg of my cycling journey with 
renewed vigor. The visit to the Rafa Nadal Academy was a perfect interlude, blending my love for all sports with a touch 
of inspiration from one of tennis’s greatest legends.

As my cycling journey in Mallorca neared its end, the anticipation for one final ride grew. Joining the social ride 
organised by the Rapha Mallorca clubhouse not only promised new routes but introduced me to a vibrant community of 
cyclists. Despite a somewhat hectic start to the morning, it wasn’t long before our group found its rhythm, bonding 
over the shared thrill of the ride.

### A Global Gathering on Two Wheels

The power of cycling to bring people together was never more apparent than on this ride, as I found myself alongside 
cyclists from as far as Berlin and Texas. Pedaling through Mallorca’s majestic mountains, our diverse backgrounds and 
stories merged into a single, moving force. Each cyclist brought their own unique flair to the group, making the 
experience rich with global camaraderie.

Our route wound through some of Mallorca’s most breathtaking landscapes. The climb was challenging, but what awaited us 
at the top made every pedal stroke worth it—the exhilarating descent was not just a physical rush but a visual feast, 
with the island’s beauty unfolding beneath our wheels. Thanks to our group leader, this thrilling descent was captured 
on video, a memorable highlight that I’ll treasure.

<figure style="text-align: center;">

After the ride, we gathered for a well-deserved celebration, sharing coffee, sandwiches, and stories of our cycling 
exploits. These moments of laughter and mutual respect among fellow cyclists underscored the day’s adventure, turning a 
simple ride into a memorable celebration of our shared passion.

## Rapha: More Than Apparel

Rapha has long been celebrated for crafting high-quality cycling gear, but it’s their ability to foster a community that 
truly sets them apart. This ride was a testament to their commitment to bringing cyclists together, not just through their

As a souvenir, I picked up Rapha Mallorca’s new jersey, adorned with names of the iconic routes I had conquered during my 
time here in Mallorca, like Cap de Formentor and Sa Calobra. Wearing it will always remind me of the incredible landscapes 
and the bonds formed over countless kilometers.

Thanking Rapha and the wonderful people of Mallorca, I couldn’t have asked for a better finale to my cycling adventure. 
The memories of this ride will linger long after my return home, a lasting tribute to the spirit of cycling and the 
island that so beautifully embodies it.
